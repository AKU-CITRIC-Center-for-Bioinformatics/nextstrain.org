title: "Contributing to Augur & Auspice Development"
---

Augur, Auspice, and all other components of the Nextstrain ecosystem are 100% open-source.
We welcome contributions in the form of pull requests and using GitHub "issues" to tell us about bugs or potential improvements.
You're welcome to [email us](mailto:hello@nextstrain.org) with any thoughts or suggestions.

> We have received a number of generous offers to contribute front-end developer effort to nextstrain (and auspice) folowing our work on [SARS-CoV-2](https://nextstrain.org/ncov).
We would be grateful for code contributions, as well as constructive criticism and advice.
A list of potential issues is being actively maintained at https://github.com/orgs/nextstrain/projects/5.


Please see the individual GitHub repos for more information about how to set up a local development environment, developer guidelines, and lists of current issues.
