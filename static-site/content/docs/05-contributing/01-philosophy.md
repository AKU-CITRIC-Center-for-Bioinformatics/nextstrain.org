title: "Our philosophy: Facilitating open-science & sharing of results"
---

From the beginning, Nextrain has had a focus on open, real-time, pre-publication sharing of results.
Every situation is different and over time we've tried to develop a range of different approaches to make steps in this direction.


We are always excited to help you contribute to nextstrain, no matter what shape this takes.
Please [get in touch with us](mailto:hello@nextstrain.org) with any specific questions and we'll be happy to help.


### Centrally maintained, regularly updated datasets

There are a number of datasets which are run by the nextstrain team or close collaborators, for instance
[zika](/zika), [influenza](/flu) and [West Nile Virus](/WNV/NA).
Each individual dataset contains links to the scientists who maintain the different datasets.

We're exited to collaborate with more groups and expand these datasets -- please [get in touch with us](mailto:hello@nextstrain.org) if this is something you'd like to be involved in.


### Community maintained datasets

To make supporting this philosophy as easy as possible, we have created a "community builds" functionality, whereby GitHub is used to store the results of your analyses and the results are available for everyone via nextstrain.org.
This is behind the [community builds](/) which you can see on the main page.

See [this page](community-builds) for more information, including a step-by-step on how you can get your datsets up as a community build. 

### Bespoke auspice deployments

Auspice can be run on your own server, including customisations to the appearence and functionality.
We have developed implementations of this using authentication for certain datasets where it's inapropriate to share the data publically.
Tutorials and documentation about this are currently being written, but [email us](mailto:hello@nextstrain.org) and we can discuss your use case.
