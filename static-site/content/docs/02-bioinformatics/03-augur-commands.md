title: "Augur Commands"
---

Augur commands -- for instance `augur parse` or `augur align` -- are designed to be stand alone commands performing one bioinformatic task.

All Augur commands are run via the `augur` program -- you can see a list of these by running `augur --help`.
More details for each command can be seen via `augur <command> --help` (e.g. `augur traits --help`).

For a list of Augur commands and their arguments please see [the augur documentation [external link]](https://nextstrain-augur.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/cli/cli.html).
