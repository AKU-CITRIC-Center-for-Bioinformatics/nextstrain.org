title: "COVID-19 Frequently Asked Questions"
---


As a team, we’ve been fielding a lot of questions about COVID-19 and how individuals and families should be preparing. We have compiled a list of the most common questions we receive and answered them with information and recommendations from resources that we trust.

With all of this, it is important to note that as COVID-19 is a novel virus, we are still learning about disease characteristics including who is most likely to become infected or experience serious illness as a result of it. Current clinical knowledge is based primarily on data from the China outbreak. We believe everyone should be taking steps to protect themselves and their families. We hope the resources below will help you to do that.

#### How quickly is COVID-19 spreading?
Based on disease modeling estimates and phylodynamic analysis, the current epidemic doubling time is about 7 days. There is uncertainty with these estimates and this rate will vary based on community contact patterns. Nonpharmaceutical interventions can be effective in reducing this rate, as we have [seen in China](https://twitter.com/jodigraphics15/status/1232484344872071168?s=20). Sudden jumps in case counts are likely due to increases in testing capacity catching cases that were previously missed by surveillance systems.

Current case counts, deaths, and recoveries are being tracked in a number of places. These are updated as regularly as possible, but may not always be immediately up to date. One dashboard that we particularly like is from the [Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=Johns+Hopkins+Center+for+Systems+Science+and+Engineering):

#### How is COVID-19 spread?
COVID-19 is a respiratory virus, which [spread in 3 main ways](https://www.aappublications.org/content/35/1/1.2):
1. Between people who are in close contact with each other (within about 6 feet, or 2 metres), through small aerosolized particles that can be produced when a person talks, coughs, or sneezes.

2. In (relatively) larger droplets that are produced someone coughs or sneezes (these can travel over similar distances).

3. Contact with surfaces or objects infected with the virus (also known as fomites). If a person touches an infected surface and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth without washing their hands, they may become sick by introducing the virus into their body.

For COVID-19 there is evidence of transmission in clinically mild and asymptomatic cases. This means that people who are infected with COVID-19 and able to transmit the virus to others may not appear, or even feel, sick.

Though there is not yet clear evidence on how long the COVID-19 virus can survive on surfaces, we expect it to be similar to other coronaviruses. Coronaviruses [can live on surfaces for anywhere from a couple hours to several days](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses), depending on the surface and the climate.

#### Who is at the highest risk for COVID-19?
Studies of patients in China have shown that most COVID-19 cases are adults. Just 2.1% of 44,672 cases in China were in individuals below 20 years of age and just 1% of those are in children under 10. Approximately 80% of people experience mild illness, 14% experience severe disease, and 5% experience critical illness. There is evidence of asymptomatic cases.

Based on case reports, individuals over 60 and those who have weakened immune systems or comorbidities like chronic lung disease, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease are at a higher risk for severe disease. Children do not seem to be at a high risk for either contracting COVID-19 or having severe disease as a result of an infection. A great graphic by [Jesse Bloom, PhD and his team](https://research.fhcrc.org/bloom/en.html) that illustrates this point and compares case fatality across age groups can be viewed [here](https://twitter.com/jbloom_lab/status/1234569176196378624?s=20). Additionally, we'd recommend looking at [this graphic](https://twitter.com/ClausWilke/status/1234619097142484992?s=20) from [Claus Wilke, PhD](https://wilkelab.org/), which re-plots the same data on a log-scale and highlights that, with the exception of children, COVID-19 is consistently worse than the seasonal flu, across all age groups. With both these graphics, it's important to note that all statistics are subject to error and biases, but these do give a ballpark idea of the risk of COVID-19 among different age groups.

More detailed information on clinical characteristics and outcomes can be found in the original journal article: [Characteristics of and Important Lessons From the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak in China by Zunyou Wu, MD, PhD and Jennifer M. McGoogan, PhD](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762130).


#### What are the symptoms of COVID-19?
The most commonly reported symptoms are fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Again, these symptoms will be mild for about 80% of cases. COVID-19 is a lower respiratory infection (so most symptoms will appear “below” the voicebox) but is a flu-like illness and how its symptoms present varies from person to person. If you are concerned about symptoms you or someone else may be having, in line with [US CDC recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/steps-when-sick.html), we suggest calling your doctor to discuss next steps.

#### What can be done to prevent or reduce the spread of COVID-19?
COVID-19 is a respiratory virus, and nonpharmaceutical interventions are the most effective tool we currently have to prevent and slow the spread of COVID-19 at this time. There is not currently a vaccine or specific treatment for COVID-19. Some key ways to implement nonpharmaceutical interventions are to:

- Practice [social distancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing), such as limiting attendance at events with large groups of people
- Stay home, especially if you are feeling ill
- Implement good hand washing practices - it is extremely important to wash your hands regularly and thoroughly (see below for how-tos!)
- Cover coughs and sneezes with your elbow or tissue
- Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands
- Disinfect frequently touched surfaces, such as doorknobs
- Begin to take your temperature every day, if you develop a fever, stay home (if possible, separated from other people you live with) and call your doctor
- Start preparations in anticipation of social distancing and potential supply chain shortages. This includes ensuring you have sufficient supplies of prescription medicine and have about a 2-week supply of food and other necessary household goods
- If possible, discuss a plan to work from home with your employer or how classes could be attended remotely

With these steps in mind, it is important _to not panic and panic buy_. Panic buying unnecessarily increases strain on supply chains and can make it difficult to ensure that everyone is able to get supplies that they need. For an excellent explanation on why we should all be having a proactive, but measured response to the situation, we recommend reading [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/firefoxx66/status/1233666678841597952?s=20) by Nextstrain team member, [Emma Hodcroft, PhD](http://emmahodcroft.com/).

#### What should you do if you think you might be sick with COVID-19?
At the time of publication, the US CDC recommends to "Call ahead to a healthcare professional if you develop a fever and symptoms of respiratory illness, such as cough or difficulty breathing, and have been in close contact with a person known to have COVID-19 or if you live in or have recently traveled to an area with ongoing spread. Tell your healthcare professional about your recent travel or contact. Your healthcare professional will work with your state’s public health department and CDC to determine if you need to be tested for COVID-19."

For more detailed information on what to do if you are concerned that you or someone you know might have COVID-19, please review the US CDC page, [What to Do if You are Sick](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/steps-when-sick.html). This page includes information for individuals who may be sick, as well as information for their family members, caregivers, and intimate partners.

#### What is the origin of the COVID-19 virus?
The origin of the virus is still unclear, however [genomic analysis](https://virological.org/t/ncovs-relationship-to-bat-coronaviruses-recombination-signals-no-snakes/331) suggests the COVID-19 virus is most closely related to viruses previously identified in bats. It is plausible that there were other intermediate animal transmissions before the introduction into humans.

*There is not evidence of snakes as an intermediary.* A good, though technical, explanation of why there is not evidence of snakes as an intermediary was written by [Kristian Andersen, PhD](https://andersen-lab.com/), at the Scripps Research Institute. This article was posted on [Virological](http://virological.org/) and can be found [here](http://virological.org/t/ncov-2019-codon-usage-and-reservoir-not-snakes-v2/339).

*There is not evidence that the COVID-19 outbreak is the result of a lab escape.*
The data we have on the COVID-19 outbreak is consistent with a zoonotic origin and inconsistent with a lab escape scenario. For a full analysis of the evidencing supporting a zoonotic origin over a lab escape origin, please read [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1230634136102064128?s=20) by Nextstrain team member, [Trevor Bedford, PhD](https://bedford.io/), which discusses this issue in-depth.

*There is not evidence that the COVID-19 virus was genetically engineered with HIV sequences.* This theory was based on a pre-print paper that has since been thoroughly debunked and the article has been withdrawn. A non-technical discussion of why this theory had no ground can be found in [this article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/victoriaforster/2020/02/02/no-coronavirus-was-not-bioengineered-to-put-pieces-of-hiv-in-it/#69d44bbc56cb) in Forbes, which links out to Nextstrain team member, [Trevor Bedford's](https://bedford.io/), [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1223666856923291648?s=20) on the same topic.
