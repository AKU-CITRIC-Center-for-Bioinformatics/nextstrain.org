Add and rename markdown pages as needed to the `./static-site/content/coronavirus/X-Y.md` where X is an integer, Y is the name which will become part of the URL. `X` simply controls the ordering in the sidebar.
If you want to add subheadings (to the sidebar you can see on the left), then create folders such as `./static-site/content/coronavirus/A-B/X-Y.md` where `A` is an integer, `B` is the subheading name and will also become part of the URL.

## Frequently Asked Questions

As a team, we’ve been fielding a lot of questions about COVID-19 and how individuals and families should be preparing. We have compiled a list of the most common questions we receive and answered them with information and recommendations from resources that we trust. 

With all of this, it is important to note that as COVID-19 is a novel virus, we are still learning about disease characteristics including who is most likely to become infected or experience serious illness as a result of it. Current clinical knowledge is based primarily on data from the China outbreak. We believe everyone should be taking steps to protect themselves and their families. We hope the resources below will help you to do that. 


## COVID-19 FAQs

#### How quickly is COVID-19 spreading?
Based on modeling estimates and phylodynamic analysis, the current epidemic doubling time is about 7 days. There is uncertainty with these estimates and this rate will vary based on community contact patterns. Nonpharmaceutical interventions can be effective in reducing this rate, as we have [seen in China](https://twitter.com/jodigraphics15/status/1232484344872071168?s=20). Sudden jumps in case counts are likely due to increased testing capacity catching cases that were not previously missed by surveillance systems.

Current case counts, deaths, and recoveries are being tracked in a number of places. These are updated as regularly as possible, but may not always be immediately up to date. One dashboards that we particularly like is from the JohnsCenter for Systems Science and Engineering:
[Johns Hopkins CSSE Dashboard](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6).

#### How is COVID-19 spread?
COVID-19 is a respiratory virus, which spread in 3 main ways:
1. Between people who are in close contact with each other (within about 6 feet, or 2 metres), through small aerosolized particles that can be produced when a person talks, coughs, or sneezes. 
2. In (relatively) larger droplets that are produced someone coughs or sneezes (these can travel over similar distances)
3. Contact with surfaces or objects infected with the virus (also known as fomites). If a person touches an infected surface and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth without washing their hands they may become sick by introducing the virus into their body.

For COVID-19 there is evidence of transmission in clinically mild and asymptomatic cases, which means people who are infected with COVID-19 and able to transmit the virus to others, may not appear, or even feel, sick.

#### Who is at the highest risk for COVID-19?
Studies of patients in China have shown that most COVID-19 cases are adults, just 2.1% of 44,672 cases in China were in individuals below 20 years of age and just 1% of those are in children under 10. Approximately 80% of people experience mild illness, 14% experience severe disease, and 5% were critically ill. There is evidence of asymptomatic cases. 

Based on case reports, individuals over 60 and those who have weakened immune systems or comorbidities like chronic lung disease, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease are at a higher risk for severe disease. Children do not seem to be at a high risk for either contracting COVID-19 or having severe disease as a result of an infection. A great graphic from [Jessie Bloom and his team](https://research.fhcrc.org/bloom/en.html that illustrates this point can be viewed [here] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbloom/CoV_vs_flu_CFR/master/CFR-stats.jpg).

More detailed information on clinical characteristics can be found in the original journal article [Characteristics of and Important Lessons From the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak in China by Dr. Zunyou Wu and Dr. Jennifer M. McGoogan](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762130).


#### What are the symptoms of COVID-19?
The most commonly reported symptoms are fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath.[^1] Again, these symptoms will be mild for about 80% of cases. COVID-19 is a lower respiratory infection (so most symptoms will appear “below” the voicebox) but has flu-like symptoms and how its symptoms present varies from person to person. If you are concerned about symptoms you or someone else may be having, we recommend calling your doctor to discuss next steps.

#### What can be done to prevent or reduce the spread of COVID-19?
COVID-19 is a respiratory virus and nonpharmaceutical interventions are the most effective tool we currently have to prevent and slow the spread of COVID-19 at this time. There is not currently a vaccine or specific treatment for COVID-19. Some ways to implement nonpharmaceutical interventions include:

- Practice [social distancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing), such as limiting attendance at events with large groups of people
- Stay home, especially if you are feeling ill.
- Implement good hand washing practices - it is extremely important to wash hands regularly  
- Cover coughs and sneezes in your elbow or tissue
- Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands
- Disinfect frequently touched surfaces, such as doorknobs
- Begint to take your temperature every day, if you develop a fever, stay home (if possible, separated from other people you live with) and call your doctor
- Start preparations in anticipation of social distancing and potential supply chain shortages. This includes ensuring you have sufficient supplies of prescription medicine and have about a 2 week supply of food and other necessary household goods. If possible, discuss a plan to work from home with your employer or how classes could be attended remotely. 

With these steps  in mind, it is important _to not panic and panic buy_. Panic buying unnecessarily increases strain on supply chains and can make it difficult to ensure that everyone is able to get supplies that they need. For an excellent explanation on why we should all be having a proactive, but measured response to the situation, we recommend reading [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/firefoxx66/status/1233666678841597952?s=20) by Nextstrain team member Emma Hodcroft, PhD.

#### What should you do if you think you might be sick with COVID-19?
If you are experiencing influenza like illness, call your doctor before going to the clinic or emergency room. If your healthcare providers are concerned that you might have COVID-19, they will have specific steps for you to follow when you arrive at the clinic that will reduce the risk of getting other sicks or contracting an infection from someone already at the clinic. If you show up to a clinic or hospital without giving advance warning, you will expose yourself to a significant number of sick people and may expose others to your illness, potentially increasing transmission. 

We also recommend that people limit unnecessary trips to the emergency room. As the number of cases increases, there is strain put on the healthcare system. Reducing the number of people arriving at clinics and hospitals will decrease this strain and health keep you away from people who may be infected with COVID-19 or other respiratory viruses. If you are experiencing a health issue that you are concerned about, we recommend contacting your doctor’s office to determine where and when the best place for you to seek care is. 

#### What is the origin of the COVID-19 virus?
The origin of the virus is still unclear, however [genomic analyis](https://virological.org/t/ncovs-relationship-to-bat-coronaviruses-recombination-signals-no-snakes/331) suggests nCoV is most closely related to viruses previously identified in bats. It is plausible that there were other intermediate animal transmissions before the introduction into humans. There is no evidence of snakes as an intermediary.

There is not evidence that the COVID-19 outbreak is the result of a lab escape. 
The data we have on the COVID-19 outbreak is consistent with a zoonotic origin and inconsistent with a lab escape scenario. For a full analysis the evidencing supporting a zoonotic origin over a lab escape origin, please read [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1230634136102064128?s=20) by Nextstrain team member Trevor Bedford, PhD, which discusses this issue in-depth.
