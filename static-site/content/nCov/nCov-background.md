## Recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus
In December 2019, a new illness was first detected in Wuhan, China.
We now know this to be another outbreak of coronavirus in humans (the 7th), and it is provisionally being called nCoV (novel coronavirus).

As of January 30th over 7,914 cases and 170 deaths [have been reported](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_outbreak_of_novel_coronavirus_(2019-nCoV)).
It's still too early to know the case fatality rate, but early indications are that it is significantly less than SARS-CoV.
The case counts are dramatically rising in part due to increased surveillance and testing.

While the outbreak seems to be centered in Wuhan, which is now [under quarantine](https://twitter.com/PDChina/status/1220060879112282117), the virus has spread throughout China and abroad, including Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, and Thailand, as well as Europe, North America, South Asia, the Middle East, and Australia. Limited local transmission outside of China has been reported.

The origin of the virus is still unclear, however [genomic analyis](https://virological.org/t/ncovs-relationship-to-bat-coronaviruses-recombination-signals-no-snakes/331) suggests nCoV is most closely related to viruses previously identified in bats.
It is plausible that there were other intermediate animal transmissions before the introduction into humans.
There is no evidence of snakes as an intermediary.

#### Nextstrain narratives

The following pages contain analysis performed using [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org).
Scrolling through the left hand sidebar will reveal paragraphs of text with a corresponding visualization of the genomic data on the right hand side.

To have full genomes of a novel and large RNA virus this quickly is a remarkable achievement.
These analyses have been made possible by the rapid and open sharing of genomic data and interpretations by scientists all around the world (see the final slide for a visualization of sequencing authorship).
