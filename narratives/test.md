## Summary

* The data here are based off a report detailing current seasonal influenza circulation patterns as of Feb 2018 and making

strain.
* The data show 1882 genomes collected between 2012 and 2018 from 113 countries. The data have been subsampled in an attempt to minimise geographic and temporal sampling biases.
