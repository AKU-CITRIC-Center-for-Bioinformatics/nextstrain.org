## Zika virus outbreaks
Zika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that was first discovered in the Zika forest of Uganda in 1947. It is most commonly spread through the bite of an infected _Aedes_ mosquito. Phylogenetically, there are two major lineages of Zika virus, the African lineage and the Asian lineage. All genomes displayed here are Asian lineage viruses.

### Outbreaks in Oceania
The first major Zika virus outbreak occurred in 2007, on Yap island, Federated States of Micronesia. Zika virus continued to migrate throughout Oceania, causing an outbreak in French Polynesia during 2013-2014.

### Introduction of Zika virus to Brazil
In early spring of 2015, Brazilian authorities notifed the WHO that they had observed transmission of a febrile illness associated with a skin rash in Northeastern Brazil. In May of 2015, Brazil's national reference laboratory confirmed Zika virus circulation in Brazil. Phylogenetic analysis of early Zika virus genomes sampled from Northeastern Brazil estimate that Zika virus was introduced to Brazil in early 2014, at least a full year before Zika virus transmission was reported via clinical surveillance.

### Spread throughout Brazil into other parts of South America and the Caribbean
Zika virus spread from Northeastern Brazil to other parts of Brazil and other countries in South America and the Caribbean. As of November 2017, over 800,000 confirmed or suspected cases of Zika virus infection have been reported in the Americas.

### Introduction into the United States
In the summer of 2016, health authorities in the United States reported local transmission on Zika virus in parts of Miami, Florida. Phylogenetic analysis of genomes collected from the Miami outbreak indicated that at least 4 introductions of Zika virus had occurred, with two of these introductions leading to sustained transmission within Florida.

### Recent large outbreaks in Asia
In addition to the epidemic in the Americas, there was also a large outbreak of Zika virus in Singapore. Between the end of August and the end of November 2016, 455 confirmed Zika virus infections occurred.
