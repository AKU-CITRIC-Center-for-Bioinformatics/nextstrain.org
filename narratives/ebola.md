# 2013-2015 West African Ebola virus epidemic

`nextstrain url=ebola?dmax=2014-01-01&p=grid`
## The beginning
Epidemiological investigations on the ground have indicated that the epidemic of Ebola virus in West Africa began in Guéckédou prefecture of Guinea in December 2013. A boy from Meliandou village is thought to have been infected by a bat from a nearby roost. Soon after members of his immediate family fell ill too.

## Early Circulation
Ebola virus was thought to be endemic to central and east Africa. Prior to the West African epidemic evidence of Ebola virus infection in the region came from a single case of a veterinarian who got infected during an autopsy of a chimpanzee by a distant relative of Ebola virus in neighbouring Côte d’Ivoire who survived. However, Lassa fever which is caused by an unrelated haemorrhagic fever virus, is endemic to West Africa and causes similar symptoms. These similarities between Lassa and Ebola may have allowed Ebola virus to spread in Guinea without setting off alarms.

For the first three months Ebola virus circulated in rural Guinea, largely between neighbouring Guéckédou and Macenta prefectures. Molecular testing in March confirms that the virus in Guinea is Ebola virus (formerly known as Zaire ebolavirus). To date understanding of Ebola virus epidemiology in the presumed bat reservoir remains poor and it is still not known how the virus travelled over 4000 km from the area where the virus is thought to be endemic and arrived to West Africa.

## Between Country Transmission
As international organisations gear up to respond, indications that Ebola virus spreading beyond Guinea come to light in March/April 2014.

The first genetic evidence of Ebola virus infection crossing country borders came from Liberia and Sierra Leone. The handful of Liberian cases did not lead to sustained chains of transmission in the country, but the introduction of Ebola virus into Sierra Leone was a major turning point in the epidemic. One of the labs belonging to the [Viral Hemorrhagic Consortium](http://www.vhfc.org/), originally set up in Kailahun district just across the border from Guinea to study Lassa fever virus, sequenced the first known Ebola virus transmission chain in Sierra Leone.

## The peak
Ebola virus disease cases peak and start coming down.

## Remaining cases

A small set of Ebola virus lineages survive the viral population crash, all restricted to Sierra Leone and Guinea.

## Finally
Last acute Ebola virus disease cases are sequenced in western Sierra Leone and Guinea.
