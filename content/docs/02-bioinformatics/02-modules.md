This markdown file is a stub. This PR will not be complete until this page is filled out.

* All modules on this page?
* TOC at the top with links?
* Description of each module's remit, command line args, output etc
* For more complicated models (freqs, timetree, titers) there could be a seperate markdown file that's linked to in the module description here
