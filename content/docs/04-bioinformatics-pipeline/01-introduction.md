Augur is the informatic processing pipeline to track evolution from sequence and serological data.
It is broken into two parts, termed [prepare](/docs/04-bioinformatics-pipeline/03-prepare) and [process](/docs/04-bioinformatics-pipeline/04-process), which result in [output JSONs for Auspice](/docs/04-bioinformatics-pipeline/exported-JSON-files).
